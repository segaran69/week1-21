<p>Kajang nowadays has transform into a <em>'sub-city'</em> on its own with unstoppable sprawling developments on its peripheral surrounding. A couple of new township has been developed to cater for more inhabitants from Kuala Lumpur such as ,<strong>Kajang Perdana</strong> and <strong>Prima Saujana</strong>, to name a few. <strong>Prima Saujana</strong> has its own golf course and at the Kajang exit from the <em>North-South Highway, Kajang Country Heights,</em> an upmarket residential estate greets you as you enter Kajang.

If you want to do golfing, <em>Kajang Hill Golf Club or Prima Saujana Golf Club</em> is ready to receive you at the very best of golf courses in Malaysia that landscape nature into its surrounding.

A new township has created more shopping convenience from Giant and Tesco hypermarkets to our own shopping complex such as <strong><em>Billion Shopping Center, Bintang Shopping Center, Metro Point and Metro Plaza to Ipoh Old Town and Coffee Bean</em></strong>. In short, Kajang is a booming town but in some sense, it still maintains its core of old times and historical memories that are here to stay.</p>

<h2>Best Place to Visit in KAJANG</h2>
<h3>Only Mining Pool Left in Kajang (at Sungai Chua) Converted into a Recreational Park</h3>

<p>Tin mining industry in the district turned out to be a relatively minor enterprise, paling in comparison to other towns in the state. This prompted the District Office to suggest moving to agriculture. Tobacco had been planted in 1890 on a trial basis in Semenyih but the project failed. Coffee was next and it gained interest amongst European planters who were applying for land for coffee planting. Chinese businessmen were equally interested and joined in the demand for land. However, at the turn of the 20th century, faced with strong competition from Brazilian coffee producers, fluctuation of coffee prices and the appearance of a fungal disease called H. vastatrix and further assisted by the outbreaks of Cephonodes hylas moth that threatened to cripple the local coffee production, the industry soon vanished from the scene.</p>

<p>A prominent person in Kajang was Raja Alang, son of Raja Berayun. He attended Malay schools in Malacca and Singapore and, upon his return, worked as a Forest Ranger in 1883. When Raja Alang ended his working career, he was made an aide to the District Officer and was his right hand man in Malay affairs. He rose to become a very influential man in Kajang. In his honour, two roads in the town were named after him but both roads have since been expunged. He also became very rich; in fact, it is said that he was the richest man in Selangor in the early 20th century. He built a mosque in Beranang, which is named after him. In his later years, he moved to Kuala Lumpur and stayed at his residence at 13, Jalan Raja Laut (present day Jalan Ipoh Kecil), in front of the former Capitol and Federal cinemas. Raja Alang died on 11 December 1927 and he was buried at the Ampang Islamic Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur. His dream of a road to be named after him became a reality when his son, Raja Muhammad was the given the privilege to rename Perkins Road in recognition for his services in the struggle to achieve independence for the Federation of Malaya.</p>

<p>Located between Jalan Tukang and Jalan Mendaling is the Sin Sze Si Ya temple, the oldest Chinese temple in Kajang. The temple was initially located at Rekoh but was later moved to its current site in Kajang in 1892. It went through some construction work in 1898 and a grand ceremony was held in 1899. Today, the temple is among thirteen Sin Sze Si Ya temples that can be found in major tin mining towns in Perak, Selangor and Negri Sembilan.</p>

<p>We all have our staple breakfast growing up and one of them is definitely Chee Cheong Fun. This stall has been operating for over 30 years and there’s no sign of stopping. Ten Hup Hong Kong style Chee Cheong Fun has patrons flocking in from all over the Kajang. You can choose from either char siew or prawn fillings; or have the best of both world and go for the mixed fillings. Each plate of silky smooth rice noodle is topped off with fried onion, then paired with fragrant shrimp paste sambal.</p>

<h3>Roti Canai 17</h3>

<p>Craving something other than rice or noodles for breakfast? Go for the classic roti canai at this famous roti canai shop in Kajang. What’s so special with the roti canai here is the sheer crispiness of the roti. Pair it with their fragrant curry and sambal, and you’ll get a crunchy zing with every bite. If you want something a bit more filling, do give their nasi lemak with curry chicken a go. It’s another favourite dish among the locals there!</p>

<h3>Rojak & Cendol Tokong</h3>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/klfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/124023158_322C8OWXsBFNt8D2HEVQJNBvccQ9BrhcGZbSf39-tmo.jpg?zoom=1.25&resize=882%2C661&ssl=1"width=850>
<p>Widely known for selling cendol and rojak, this has been a go-to-stall for everyone from around the area. Although both desserts/snacks have been raved by many but the main highlight has slowly shifted to its Maggi/Mee Goreng. As basic as it may sound, their Maggi Goreng is to die for. Tossed in a wok to utter perfection, every ingredient on the plate taste equally delicious as the next one.</p>
